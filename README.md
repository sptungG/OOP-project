## 4. Demonstration of sorting algorithms on array (2)
### Overview:

 Array is the most basic structure of computer science. Most operations as well as other data structures are built and performed on array. In this project, you will make an application in order to explain three sorting algorithms on array:

* bubble sort
* quick sort
